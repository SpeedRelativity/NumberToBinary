Project intended to learn javascript.

Created UI in html/css. 
Used Javascript to use the input and calculate the binary of the numbers.
NumToBitRep = (inputValue >>> 0).toString(2) is how I converted the input into binary. toString(2) the 2 acts as the radix, in this case, 2 representing binary.

I used a .onclick event listener to initiate the function. 
Very similar to the Lua block:MouseButton1Click:connect(function()) event. (relating to past experience to remember it better).
